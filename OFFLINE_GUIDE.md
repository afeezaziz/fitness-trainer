## Technical Implementation

### Service Worker (`/static/js/service-worker.js`)
- Caches static assets for offline use
- Handles fetch requests for offline functionality
- Manages background sync for data synchronization

### Offline Manager (`/static/js/offline.js`)
- Manages IndexedDB storage
- Handles form submissions when offline
- Provides UI feedback for online/offline status
- Manages installation prompts

### App Manifest (`/static/manifest.json`)
- Defines app metadata
- Provides app icons
- Configures display modes and shortcuts

### Database Structure
- **offlineData**: Stores pending sync operations

## Development Notes

### Adding New Offline Features
